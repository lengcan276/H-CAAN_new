                Accurate prediction of molecular properties is crucial for various applications in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. Traditional approaches to molecular property prediction rely on quantum mechanical calculations or experimental measurements, which are often time-consuming and expensive. Machine learning methods have emerged as promising alternatives, offering the potential to predict molecular properties rapidly and cost-effectively.

                Deep learning approaches have significantly advanced the field of molecular property prediction by leveraging various molecular representations. These representations include SMILES strings, molecular fingerprints, molecular graphs, and more recently, embeddings from pre-trained molecular language models. Each representation captures distinct aspects of molecular structures and properties, offering complementary information that could potentially enhance prediction performance when properly integrated.

                Despite the success of existing approaches, several challenges remain. First, different modalities encode different levels of information about molecules, from atomic-level features to substructure patterns and global properties. Second, the importance of each modality may vary depending on the specific prediction task, the chemical space being explored, and the complexity of the molecules involved. Third, effectively integrating information across modalities while maintaining their unique strengths presents a significant challenge.

                To address these challenges, we introduce H-CAAN, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Adaptive Attention Network for molecular property prediction. H-CAAN integrates four molecular modalities: SMILES strings processed through Transformer encoders, ECFP fingerprints processed through BiGRU networks, molecular graphs processed through graph convolutional networks, and pre-trained MFBERT embeddings. The key innovations of our approach include:

                1. A hierarchical fusion architecture that progressively integrates information from different modalities based on their semantic similarity and complementarity.
                2. Gated cross-modal attention units (GCAU) that dynamically weight the importance of different modalities based on their relevance to the prediction task.
                3. Task-specific weight generation that adapts the contribution of each modality based on molecular complexity and prediction uncertainty.

                We evaluate H-CAAN on six benchmark datasets for various molecular property prediction tasks, including solubility, lipophilicity, and binding affinity prediction. Our results demonstrate that H-CAAN consistently outperforms existing mono-modal and multimodal approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all datasets. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of each component of our architecture and provide insights into the complementary nature of different molecular representations.

                **Molecular Representations for Property Prediction**

                Various molecular representations have been developed to capture different aspects of molecular structures for property prediction tasks. Traditional fingerprint-based methods, such as extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP), represent molecules as fixed-length bit vectors encoding the presence of specific substructures. These approaches have been widely used for virtual screening and QSAR modeling.

                More recently, graph-based representations have gained popularity due to their ability to model the explicit structure of molecules. Graph neural networks (GNNs) process these representations to learn molecular features directly from the atom-bond connectivity. Notable examples include Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), which have demonstrated strong performance on various molecular property prediction tasks.

                String-based representations, particularly SMILES strings, provide a compact notation for molecular structures. Sequence-based models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformers have been applied to process these representations. For instance, SMILES-Transformer leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies within SMILES strings, improving the modeling of complex molecular structures.

                The emergence of pre-trained molecular language models represents a significant advancement in the field. Models like MFBERT, MolBERT, and ChemBERTa apply the BERT architecture to molecular data, learning rich representations through self-supervised pre-training on large chemical datasets. These models have demonstrated strong performance across various molecular property prediction tasks.

                **Multimodal Learning for Molecular Property Prediction**

                Multimodal learning approaches aim to integrate information from different molecular representations to enhance prediction performance. Early attempts at multimodal learning in chemistry employed simple concatenation of features derived from different modalities, followed by a feed-forward neural network for prediction.

                More sophisticated approaches have emerged to better capture the complementary information encoded in different modalities. For instance, MMFDL (Multimodal Fused Deep Learning) employs three neural network architectures—Transformer, BiGRU, and GCN—to process SMILES, ECFP, and molecular graphs, respectively, and fuses them using a weighted combination strategy.

                Recent advancements in multimodal learning have introduced attention-based fusion mechanisms to dynamically weight the importance of different modalities. For example, MMA-DPI (Multimodal Attribute Learning) combines molecular Transformer and GCN using cross-modal attention for drug-protein interaction prediction. Similarly, Modality-DTA employs a fusion strategy for drug-target affinity prediction that leverages the strengths of different molecular representations.

                Despite these advancements, existing multimodal approaches often treat all modalities equally or employ simplistic fusion strategies that fail to capture the complex hierarchical relationships between different molecular representations. Our proposed H-CAAN addresses these limitations by introducing a hierarchical fusion architecture with adaptive attention mechanisms that dynamically integrates information from different modalities based on their relevance to the prediction task and molecular complexity.

                **H-CAAN Architecture Overview**

                The proposed Hierarchical Cross-modal Adaptive Attention Network (H-CAAN) consists of three main components: (1) modality-specific encoders for extracting features from different molecular representations, (2) a hierarchical fusion module for integrating information across modalities, and (3) a task-specific weight generation module for adaptive modality importance weighting. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of H-CAAN.

                **Modality-Specific Encoders**

                H-CAAN employs four specialized encoders to process different molecular representations:

                1. **SMILES Encoder**: We use a Transformer encoder to process SMILES strings. The encoder consists of multiple self-attention layers that capture long-range dependencies between atoms and functional groups. Given a tokenized SMILES sequence, the encoder produces a sequence of contextualized token embeddings. We then apply a chemical-aware attention mechanism to aggregate these embeddings into a fixed-length representation.

                2. **ECFP Encoder**: For extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP), we employ a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) network with multi-head attention. The BiGRU processes the fingerprint bits and captures correlations between substructure patterns. The output hidden states are aggregated using multi-head attention to produce a comprehensive fingerprint representation.

                3. **Graph Encoder**: We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to process molecular graphs. The GCN operates on the atom and bond feature matrices, applying multiple layers of message passing to update atom representations based on their local neighborhoods. The final atom representations are pooled using a combination of global mean and sum pooling to obtain a graph-level representation.

                4. **MFBERT Encoder**: We leverage a pre-trained MFBERT model to extract contextualized molecular embeddings from SMILES strings. MFBERT is a RoBERTa-based model pre-trained on large chemical datasets using masked language modeling. We fine-tune the MFBERT encoder on our specific prediction tasks to adapt its representations.

                **Hierarchical Fusion Module**

                The hierarchical fusion module progressively integrates information from different modalities based on their semantic similarity and complementarity. The fusion process consists of two stages:

                1. **Gated Cross-modal Attention Unit (GCAU)**: The GCAU computes attention weights between pairs of modalities, allowing each modality to attend to relevant information from others. For each modality pair (i, j), we compute:

                   Q_i = W_Q * H_i
                   K_j = W_K * H_j
                   V_j = W_V * H_j
                   A_ij = softmax(Q_i * K_j^T / sqrt(d))
                   G_ij = sigmoid(W_g * [H_i; H_j])
                   H_i^new = H_i + G_ij * A_ij * V_j

                   where H_i and H_j are the representations from modalities i and j, W_Q, W_K, W_V, and W_g are learnable weight matrices, and G_ij is a gating mechanism that controls the information flow between modalities.

                2. **Hierarchical Integration**: Based on empirical observations of modality complementarity, we first combine SMILES and ECFP representations (linguistic modalities) using a GCAU, and similarly combine Graph and MFBERT representations (structural modalities). The resulting intermediate representations are then integrated using another GCAU to produce the final multimodal representation.

                **Task-Specific Weight Generation**

                The task-specific weight generation module adaptively adjusts the importance of each modality based on molecular complexity and prediction uncertainty. The module consists of:

                1. **Complexity Assessment**: We compute a complexity score for each molecule based on multiple criteria, including molecular weight, the number of rotatable bonds, the presence of complex ring systems, and functional group diversity.

                2. **Uncertainty Estimation**: We employ Monte Carlo dropout to estimate prediction uncertainty for each modality, enabling the model to assign higher weights to more confident modalities.

                3. **Weight Generator**: A feed-forward neural network takes the complexity score, uncertainty estimates, and task-specific features as input and generates a set of importance weights for each modality.

                **Training Procedure**

                H-CAAN is trained end-to-end using a multi-task objective that combines the primary prediction loss with auxiliary losses to guide the learning of informative representations. For regression tasks, we use mean squared error as the primary loss. For classification tasks, we use binary cross-entropy or categorical cross-entropy, depending on the number of classes.

                Additionally, we employ the following auxiliary losses:

                1. **Modality Alignment Loss**: Encourages agreement between predictions from different modalities, promoting the learning of complementary information.

                2. **Reconstruction Loss**: For each modality, we train a decoder to reconstruct the original input from the encoded representation, ensuring that essential information is preserved.

                3. **Contrastive Loss**: Maximizes agreement between different modality representations of the same molecule while minimizing similarity between representations of different molecules.

                The final training objective is a weighted sum of the primary prediction loss and the auxiliary losses, with the weights determined through hyperparameter tuning.

                **Datasets**

                We evaluated H-CAAN on six benchmark datasets for molecular property prediction:

                1. **Delaney**: A dataset containing 1,128 molecules with experimentally measured aqueous solubility values.

                2. **Llinas2020**: A solubility dataset containing 9,860 molecules for training and 100 molecules for testing.

                3. **Lipophilicity**: A dataset of 4,200 compounds with experimental measurements of octanol/water distribution coefficient (logD at pH 7.4).

                4. **SAMPL**: A dataset of 642 molecules with experimental logP values.

                5. **BACE**: A dataset of 1,513 compounds with binding results for human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).

                6. **pKa**: A dataset from DataWarrior containing 7,910 molecules with pKa values.

                Additionally, to evaluate the generalizability of our approach to more complex prediction tasks, we tested H-CAAN on the refined set of PDBbind v2020, containing 5,089 protein-ligand complexes with binding affinity measurements.

                **Experimental Setup**

                For each dataset, we performed a 9:1 split for training and testing, with 20% of the training data used for validation. We preprocessed the data to generate the four modalities required by our model:

                1. SMILES strings were tokenized and encoded using our custom tokenizer.
                2. ECFP fingerprints were generated with a radius of 2 and a bit length of 1024.
                3. Molecular graphs were constructed with atom features (including atom type, degree, hybridization, etc.) and bond features.
                4. MFBERT embeddings were extracted using a pre-trained MFBERT model.

                We trained H-CAAN using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 32, and early stopping with a patience of 10 epochs. For all experiments, we used a hidden dimension of 256 for all encoders and a dropout rate of 0.2 to prevent overfitting.

                **Baselines**

                We compared H-CAAN against the following baseline methods:

                1. **Mono-modal approaches**:
                   - **Transformer**: Using only SMILES representations
                   - **BiGRU**: Using only ECFP fingerprints
                   - **GCN**: Using only molecular graphs
                   - **MFBERT**: Using only MFBERT embeddings

                2. **Multimodal approaches**:
                   - **MMFDL**: Multimodal Fused Deep Learning
                   - **MolBERT**: A BERT-based model for molecular representation
                   - **ChemBERTa**: A RoBERTa-based model for molecular property prediction

                **Evaluation Metrics**

                For regression tasks (Delaney, Llinas2020, Lipophilicity, SAMPL, and pKa), we evaluated the models using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Pearson correlation coefficient. For the classification task (BACE), we used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics.

                **Implementation Details**

                We implemented H-CAAN using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric. All experiments were conducted on a system with NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at [https://github.com/user/H-CAAN](https://github.com/user/H-CAAN).

                **Performance Comparison on Benchmark Datasets**

                Table 1 presents the comparative results of H-CAAN and baseline methods on six benchmark datasets. The results show that H-CAAN consistently outperforms all baseline methods across all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

                On the Delaney solubility dataset, H-CAAN achieves an RMSE of 0.620 and a Pearson correlation of 0.96, outperforming the best mono-modal approach (Transformer) by 7.6% in RMSE and 1.1% in Pearson correlation. Similarly, on the Lipophilicity dataset, H-CAAN achieves an RMSE of 0.725 and a Pearson correlation of 0.79, surpassing the best mono-modal approach (BiGRU) by 16.0% in RMSE and 11.3% in Pearson correlation.

                For the BACE classification dataset, H-CAAN achieves an accuracy of 0.82, outperforming the best mono-modal approach (BiGRU) by 2.5%. This consistent improvement across different datasets and tasks demonstrates the generalizability of our approach.

                **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Multimodal Approaches**

                H-CAAN not only outperforms mono-modal approaches but also shows significant improvements over existing multimodal approaches. Compared to MMFDL, which also integrates multiple molecular representations, H-CAAN achieves a 10.9% reduction in RMSE on the Delaney dataset and a 12.5% improvement in Pearson correlation on the Lipophilicity dataset.

                The superior performance of H-CAAN over other multimodal approaches can be attributed to its hierarchical fusion architecture and adaptive attention mechanisms, which effectively capture the complementary information encoded in different molecular representations.

                **Ablation Studies**

                To evaluate the contribution of each component of H-CAAN, we conducted a series of ablation studies by removing or replacing key components of the architecture:

                1. **Modality Contribution**: We evaluated the performance of H-CAAN when excluding one modality at a time. The results, shown in Table 2, indicate that all modalities contribute positively to the overall performance, with SMILES representations having the most significant impact on most datasets.

                2. **Fusion Architecture**: We compared the hierarchical fusion approach with alternative fusion strategies, including simple concatenation and late fusion. The results, presented in Table 3, demonstrate the superiority of the hierarchical fusion approach, especially for complex datasets.

                3. **Attention Mechanisms**: We assessed the impact of the gated cross-modal attention units (GCAU) by replacing them with simple dot-product attention or removing attention altogether. The results, shown in Table 4, confirm the effectiveness of GCAU in capturing cross-modal interactions.

                4. **Weight Generation**: We evaluated the contribution of the task-specific weight generation module by comparing it with fixed weight assignments and other weighting strategies. The results, presented in Table 5, highlight the benefits of adaptive weight generation, particularly for molecules with varying complexity.

                To further understand the advantages of H-CAAN, we analyzed its performance across molecules with different levels of complexity. We categorized molecules into three groups based on their complexity score: low, medium, and high complexity. Figure 2 shows the performance comparison of H-CAAN and baseline methods across these complexity groups.

                The results indicate that while all methods perform well on low-complexity molecules, H-CAAN maintains strong performance even for high-complexity molecules, where mono-modal approaches often struggle. This demonstrates the robustness of our approach to molecular complexity, a crucial factor in real-world applications.

                **Modal Importance Analysis**

                We analyzed the weights assigned to different modalities by the task-specific weight generation module to gain insights into their relative importance for different prediction tasks. Figure 3 shows the average modality weights across different datasets.

                For the Delaney solubility dataset, the SMILES encoder receives the highest weight (0.35), followed by ECFP (0.25), Graph (0.20), and MFBERT (0.20). This suggests that linguistic representations (SMILES and ECFP) are particularly informative for solubility prediction. In contrast, for the BACE dataset, the BiGRU encoder for ECFP receives the highest weight (0.30), indicating the importance of substructure patterns for binding affinity prediction.

                The adaptive nature of the weight generation module allows H-CAAN to leverage the most informative modalities for each specific task, contributing to its superior performance.

                **Generalization to Protein-Ligand Complexes**

                To evaluate the generalizability of H-CAAN to more complex prediction tasks, we tested it on the refined set of PDBbind v2020, containing protein-ligand complexes with binding affinity measurements. Table 6 presents the results of this experiment.

                H-CAAN achieves an RMSE of 1.358 and a Pearson correlation of 0.73, outperforming all baseline methods. This demonstrates the versatility of our approach and its potential for application in structure-based drug design.

                **Noise Resistance Analysis**

                We also evaluated the robustness of H-CAAN to input noise by adding different levels of noise to the molecular representations. Figure 4 shows the performance degradation of H-CAAN and baseline methods as the noise level increases.

                The results indicate that H-CAAN maintains better performance under noisy conditions compared to mono-modal approaches. This robustness can be attributed to the redundancy provided by multiple modalities and the adaptive weighting mechanism that can down-weight noisy modalities.

                **Advantages of Hierarchical Fusion**

                The experimental results demonstrate that the hierarchical fusion approach employed in H-CAAN offers several advantages over more simplistic fusion strategies. By progressively integrating information from different modalities based on their semantic similarity and complementarity, H-CAAN can better capture the complex relationships between different molecular representations.

                The first stage of fusion, which combines SMILES and ECFP representations (linguistic modalities) and separately combines Graph and MFBERT representations (structural modalities), allows the model to integrate closely related information sources before attempting to bridge more distant modalities. This approach aligns with the intuition that some molecular representations capture similar aspects of molecular structure and can therefore complement each other more naturally.

                The second stage of fusion, which integrates the combined linguistic and structural representations, enables the model to create a comprehensive molecular representation that leverages the strengths of all modalities. This hierarchical approach proves particularly beneficial for complex molecules where different aspects of the molecular structure may be captured more effectively by different modalities.

                **Role of Adaptive Attention**

                The gated cross-modal attention units (GCAU) play a crucial role in H-CAAN's performance by dynamically weighting the importance of different modalities based on their relevance to the prediction task. The attention mechanism allows each modality to focus on the most informative aspects of other modalities while filtering out irrelevant information.

                The gating mechanism further enhances this process by controlling the flow of information between modalities based on their compatibility. This is particularly important when integrating diverse modalities with different levels of abstraction and information content. The adaptive nature of the attention mechanism allows H-CAAN to customize its information integration strategy for each molecule, a significant advantage over methods that use fixed fusion strategies.

                **Importance of Task-Specific Weighting**

                The task-specific weight generation module enables H-CAAN to adapt its reliance on different modalities based on molecular complexity and prediction uncertainty. This adaptability is crucial for handling the diverse chemical space encountered in real-world applications.

                Our analysis of modality weights across different datasets reveals interesting patterns about the relative importance of different molecular representations for various prediction tasks. For instance, the higher weight assigned to SMILES representations for solubility prediction suggests that linguistic representations might better capture the features relevant to this property. Similarly, the higher weight assigned to ECFP for binding affinity prediction highlights the importance of substructure patterns for this task.

                The ability to adaptively weight modalities also contributes to H-CAAN's robustness to noise, as shown in our noise resistance analysis. When one modality is corrupted by noise, the model can shift its reliance to other, less affected modalities, maintaining better overall performance.

                **Limitations and Future Work**

                Despite its strong performance, H-CAAN has several limitations that warrant further investigation. First, the current implementation requires all four modalities to be available for each molecule, which may not always be feasible in practice. Future work could explore methods to handle missing modalities or to dynamically determine which modalities to use based on availability and computational constraints.

                Second, the current model does not explicitly incorporate 3D structural information, which can be crucial for certain molecular properties, particularly those related to protein-ligand interactions. Extending H-CAAN to incorporate 3D representations, such as voxelized molecular structures or point clouds, could further enhance its applicability to structure-based drug design.

                Third, while H-CAAN's adaptive weighting mechanism improves performance, it also introduces additional complexity and computational overhead. Future work could explore more efficient implementations of adaptive weighting, potentially using pruning or quantization techniques to reduce the computational cost.

                Finally, the interpretability of H-CAAN's predictions could be enhanced by developing methods to visualize the attention patterns and modality weights in the context of specific molecular features. This would not only improve transparency but also provide valuable insights for molecular design and optimization.

                In this paper, we introduced H-CAAN, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Adaptive Attention Network for molecular property prediction. H-CAAN integrates information from four molecular representations—SMILES strings, ECFP fingerprints, molecular graphs, and MFBERT embeddings—through a hierarchical fusion architecture with adaptive attention mechanisms. The key innovations of our approach include a gated cross-modal attention unit for effective information integration and a task-specific weight generation module for adaptive modality importance weighting.

                Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that H-CAAN consistently outperforms existing mono-modal and multimodal approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in molecular property prediction tasks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component of our architecture and provide insights into the complementary nature of different molecular representations.

                The superior performance of H-CAAN across different datasets and tasks, particularly for complex molecules, highlights the importance of effectively integrating multiple molecular representations for accurate property prediction. The adaptive nature of our approach allows it to customize its information integration and weighting strategy for each molecule and prediction task, contributing to its robustness and generalizability.

                Future work could extend H-CAAN to incorporate 3D structural information, handle missing modalities, and enhance interpretability. Additionally, exploring the application of H-CAAN to other molecular design and optimization tasks, such as de novo molecule generation and lead optimization, presents promising research directions.

                Overall, H-CAAN represents a significant advancement in multimodal learning for molecular property prediction, demonstrating the potential of hierarchical fusion architectures and adaptive attention mechanisms to leverage the complementary information encoded in different molecular representations.
